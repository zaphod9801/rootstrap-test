# Data Scientist Challenge

## Description of the problem


> **Note**: Code must be develop using **Python** and shared in **github**.

> **Note**: **jupyter** notebook should be used for exploratory data analysis (**EDA**).

---

In this challenge you will have to **run 2 machine learning** models that solve a problem you'll define from ONE of the provided data sets you will choose and then compare the results.

Keep in mind that the main goal of this challenge is not to get good performance on the models, but rather to validate the process you follow to solve the problem.

#### Tasks you'll need to perfom:
1. From ONE of the provided data sets below, you must define a problem to solve with supervised learning, specify the target variable and the metric to be used.
2. Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the data. During the analysis, make decisions about how the data will be processed, identifying transformations to be carried out during the preparation of the data.
3. Develop the code to execute the preparation of the data and then execute the models.
4. Evaluate the models and stablish a comparison between them.
5. Identify problems that the models have and mention how they could be solved to improve the result.

#### Output expected:
Github repo including:
1. Readme with decisions made
2. Code developed to resolve challenge
3. Include jupyter notebook inside the repo

#### Possible Datasets to be used for the challenge, you should choose ONLY 1:
